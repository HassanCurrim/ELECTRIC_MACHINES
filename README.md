# INDUCTION MACHINE MODEL
This is a model of an induction machine (IM) that is used in a hypothetical fluid transport system
The goal of the control scheme developed is to ensure that the IM is able to follow a given speed profile such that it can transport the required amount of fluid
PID Controllers were used 
The parameters for the controllers were determined using the PIDtuner tool in MATLAB
